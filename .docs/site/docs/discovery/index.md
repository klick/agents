# Discovery Files

The plugin exposes two public machine-readable discovery documents:

- `/llms.txt`
- `/commerce.txt`

These files are generated dynamically and support cache validators:

- `ETag`
- `Last-Modified`
- `304 Not Modified`

These surfaces are intentionally public and are not token-guarded.

Continue with:

- [llms.txt & commerce.txt details](/discovery/llms-and-commerce)
